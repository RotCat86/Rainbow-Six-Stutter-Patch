# Rainbow-Six-Stutter-Patch
This is a very simple script that fixes the long ongoing bottleneck that causes stutter/lag after a couple of games. 
The solution was created TWO YERAS AGO by u/SquishyShibe in a post linked below. There is also a full guide on how to create the script by yourself that was done by Mikeplayer on Steam which i did not know prior to creating my executable; i will also link his post since i want to credit him for creating it before me.
